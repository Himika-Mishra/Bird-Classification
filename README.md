# Bird-Classification

To Reproduce the project:

1. Download the zipfile and upload it in your Google Drive.

2. Upload the Birds_Classification.ipynb in the google collab.

3. Run all cells to reproduce same results.

4. The best model i.e. Resnet101 has been implemented

5. The rest 2 models i.e. Resnet50 and Efficientnet_b0 has been hashed. So to run those cells, just un hash the particular Model.
Note: It is recommended to download the data in the google drive and save it with name birds.zip the notebook should be run in google colab environment with gpu for the best results. if you have to run the model in any other environment the path needs to be changed in whole file.
